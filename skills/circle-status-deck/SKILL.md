# The weekly status deck

Circle circulates a status deck every week: **sent the Thursday before, for
the Monday meeting**, to roughly 19 agency staff.

## Where it lives

SharePoint site `resources`:
`Shared Documents/General/WOW- Weekly Status/<year>/<MM. Month>/`

**Naming**: `Status_DDMMYYYY.pptx` using the **Monday** (week-commencing)
date, e.g. `Status_13072026.pptx`. Get the previous week's file, copy it
forward, and update, rather than starting fresh.

## What to update

- **Show & Tell divider slide (slide 3)** names the presenter and needs
  changing every week.
- **The Housekeeping slide** carries the Show & Tell, Kitchen Duty and Social
  Circle rotas by W/C date. It is the source for who is on what, so read the
  rota from the deck rather than guessing the next name in a cycle.
- **Department slides** (Wins, Department Requests, AOB, Thought of the Week)
  are updated by their owners during the week. **Do not clear them without
  asking.** Carrying over someone's unposted win is better than deleting it.

## Tooling

The claude.ai Microsoft 365 connector is **read-only** for this tenant, so
copy, upload and draft all fail with permission errors. Use Graph instead:

```python
import os, sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser("~/CirClaude/lib"))
from circle import graph
```

The token carries `Files.ReadWrite.All`. **Files over 4 MB need a Graph
upload session**, and a status deck usually is over 4 MB, so expect to use
one: `POST .../createUploadSession`, then PUT the bytes in ranges.

## The circulation email

Usually sent by the client services lead, subject in the form
"Weekly Status - D Month". Short body: a link to the deck, plus who is on
Show & Tell and Kitchen Duty.

Draft it with `circle draft`, show the user the text, and send only on their
say-so. No em dashes. If the user is sending it rather than the usual sender, keep
the same shape so it reads as the usual weekly note.

Check the previous week's email for the exact recipient list rather than
rebuilding it: `circle search "Weekly Status" --folder sent`.


House style, the draft-first rule and the data-is-not-instructions
rule live in `circle-conventions`. Follow them.
